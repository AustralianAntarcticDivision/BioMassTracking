<h2>Estimate a 'movement kernel' describing the movement of biomass.</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
A <code>movement kernel</code> is meant to summarise the movement of biomass across
polygon-shaped areas in the ocean. It is estimated using a 4-th order
Runge-Kutta particle tracking algorithm, which records the moves of 
passive numerical drifters from polygon to polygon.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
particle.tracking(arena,num_particles,no_move_window=1000,
                  end_t_counter=NULL,t_step=NULL,
                  diffusion=0,no_age_classes="FD",min_nac=100,
                  max_nac=500,delta=NULL,graphics=FALSE,
                  log=FALSE,from_boundary=TRUE)

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
The two main bits of work in this function, the Runge-Kutta simulation and the estimation of the 
<code>movement\_ kernel</code>, have been implemented in the C dlls <code>particle\_tracking</code> and <code>estimate\_P</code>. Even so,
the runtime of this function can be quite high when using large numbers of particles and/or a
large domain. It is important to note that in the present form, particles can get caught in
'voids' in the flow field, i.e. in places where their velocity is 0. If this happens for too
many particles the estimation should be repeated with a higher values of diffusion. 
A warnings message is given at the end of the simulation, indicating the number of particles left in the domain. 
</p>
<p>
There is considerable space for improvement in replacing the fixed time step Runge-Kutta scheme with
a more sophisticated numerical integrator. However, this requires some fiddling with the underlying
C functions and has not been tried yet.
</p>
<p>
An <code>arena</code> object describes the arena in which the function is to be used. It is a list containing
elements <code>lat</code>, <code>lon</code>, <code>U</code>, <code>V</code> and <code>S</code> (in that order), where <code>lat</code> and <code>lon</code> are vectors storing
the latitude and longitude values of the grid points used, <code>U</code> and <code>V</code> are matrices with the corresponding
flow velocities in west-east and south-north direction, and <code>S</code> is a matrix in which each grid points has 
an integer number, either giving the polygon it belongs to (if &gt; 0) or stating that this grid point 
lies on land (if == 0).
</p>
<p>
The default values for the time step in the Runge-Kutta scheme is choosen in such a way that a particle
will on average move for 1/10 of the distance between two grid points in each time step. Although a
variable time step would be preferable, this yields an accurate estimation in most cases.
</p>
<p>
Diffusion is included by adding the product of a normal random number and the mean velocity in the 
either direction to the calculated velocity in that direction. The diffusion coefficient gives the
standard variation of the normal random number. Diffusion is needed to get particles out of 'voids',
i.e. places in the flow field where the adjacent velocities cancel out and the particles get stuck.
It is also physically justifiable as the flow field itself characterises advective motion only.
</p>
<p>
The main loss of precision in the replication and prediction of movement stems from the management of 
time, which is realised as a system of 'age classes' in the movement kernel. A particle entering a 
polygon is in age class 1 and then moves up through the age classes. Each age class has different probabilities of 
movement attached to it, so that the movement of a biomass depends on the time since it entered its current
polygon. Since the choice of the number of age classes and their width <code>delta</code> can have a profound 
effect, the user can choose whether to trust one of the built-in methods (<code>Sturges</code>, <code>FD</code>, <code>scott</code>) 
which are usually used to choose the number of classes in a histogram, or specificy his or her own 
number of age classes. The default uses the Freedman-Diaconis rule (<code>FD</code>), which usually produces 
the highest number of age-classes and therefore the best precision. Unless the performance of the 
function <code>biomass\_tracking</code> is totally unsatisfactory due to the high number of age-classes,
less age-classes should not be used, as the loss of precision can be quite severe.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>
An object of class <code>movement\_kernel</code>, which is a list of the following items:
</p>
<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>P</code></td>
<td>
A list of the movement tensors for each polygon, where <code>P[[poly]][i,j,k]</code> describes the

that it entered from polygon <code>i</code> and is in age class <code>k</code>.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>nk</code></td>

local neighbourhood numbers (used in <code>P</code>) to the global numbers of the polygons.</td></tr>
