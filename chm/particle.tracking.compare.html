<h2>Track the movement of biomass as passive drifters</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
This functions tracks the movement of biomass through the given polygons by following
the proportionate distribution of a large number of passive drifter (small fluid parcels) 
trajectories, which are calculated using a 4th-order Runge-Kutta integration scheme.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
particle.tracking.compare(arena,num_particles,t_step,end_t_counter,
                          start_setup=NULL,infl_poly=1,insert_time=10,
                          subdiv=NULL,diffusion=0,silent=TRUE,graphics=FALSE)
</pre>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>
There are two different starting conditions for the flow of biomass: A starting distribution can
be given or the biomass can flow into the area through a specified inflow polygon in a certain 
number of time steps.
</p>
<p>
A call to the C-function <code>particle\_tracking\_compare\_inflow</code> does the bulk of work,
which is a lot faster than the same implementation in R due to the greatly increased efficiency
of 'for' loops. It is important to note that in the present form, particles can get caught in
'voids' in the flow field, i.e. in places where their velocity is 0. If this happens for too
many particles (a warnings message is given at the end, indicating the number of particles left
in the domain), the estimation should be repeated with a higher values of diffusion.
</p>
<p>
There is considerable space for improvement in replacing the fixed time step Runge-Kutta scheme with
a more sophisticated numerical integrator. However, this requires some fiddling with the underlying
C functions and has not been tried yet.
</p>
<p>
An <code>arena</code> object describes the arena in which the function is to be used. It is a list containing
elements <code>lat</code>, <code>lon</code>, <code>U</code>, <code>V</code> and <code>S</code> (in that order), 
where <code>lat</code> and <code>lon</code> are vectors storing the latitude and longitude values of the 
grid points used, <code>U</code> and <code>V</code> are matrices with the corresponding
flow velocities in west-east and south-north direction, and <code>S</code> is a matrix in which each grid points has 
an integer number, either giving the polygon it belongs to (if &gt; 0) or stating that this grid point 
lies on land (if == 0).
</p>
<p>
The default value for <code>subdiv</code> is choosen in such a way that a particle will on average move for 1/10 
of the distance between two grid points in each time step. Although a variable time step would be preferable,
this yields an accurate estimation in most cases.
</p>
<p>
Diffusion is included by adding the product of a normal random variable and the mean velocity to the 
calculated velocity in either direction. The diffusion coefficient gives the
standard variation of the normal random number. Diffusion is needed to get particles out of 'voids',
i.e. places in the flow field where the adjacent velocities cancel out and the particles get stuck.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>
A matrix of dimension 'number of polygons' x 'number of time steps', where the last polygon is the
'outside'. Each column holds the biomass distribution in the respective time step.</p>

arena = prepare.arena(Udata,Vdata,Sdata)
plot(arena)

# Use more particles if realistic results are needed
mk = particle.tracking(arena,400,5000,diffusion=0.6,graphics=TRUE)

# Now estimate the biomass movement
N1 = biomass.tracking(mk,seq(0,4900,by=100),infl_poly=2)

# Get a particle tracking result to compare the above to
N2 = particle.tracking.compare(arena,400,100,50,diffusion=0.6,infl_poly=2)

# Compare the results
biomass.compare(N1,N2)
